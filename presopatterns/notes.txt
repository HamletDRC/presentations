#Context of Presentation Model Pattern: 
     Applicable to any event-based GUI toolkit, e.g.
     * Swing, JavaFX, AWT, SWT, and their complements
     * Flex
     * Windows Presentation Foundation
     * Server side: GWT(?), Canoo RIA Suite

# About Model <-> View <-> Controller
     EG 1: Data Model <-> Application <-> Services
     EG 2: Object Model <-> Presentation <-> Workflow
     EG 3: Presentation Model <-> Widget <-> Listener
     EG 4: Widget Model <-> Visual <-> Editor

# This talk is about EG 3: Presentation Model <-> Widget <-> Listener



# Forces: Talk about MVC Coupling
     MVC Arrow Overload

# Solution Ideas: Event Bus + Presentation Model

# Event Bus 1 - GWT
     - Show Diagram (old). Q: How do components talk to one another? 
     - Show Demo - Comment in Code
     - Show all the classes required to make this work (events package)
     - Show Diagram (new) 
     pros - It works, it is type safe
     cons - It is complex, it's a lot to type, doesn't work across modules (no shared objects)

# Event Bus 2 - Flex & Pure MVC
     - show image
     - "in fairness" we had success with the event notification part

# Event Bus 3 - Griffon
     - Show diagram (old). Q: How do controllers talk to one another? 
          - THIS is your maintenance nightmare, not binding
     - Show Demo
     - Show Diagram (new) 
     pros - Simple, it works application wide, convention over configuration
     cons - It is Groovy, Stringly Typed, No "Enterprise Flexibility"

# Event Bus 4 - CDI
     - JSR 299: Contexts and Dependency Injection for the JavaTM EE platform
     - Show Demo
     pros: works with Java SE, with JSR, Oracle backed, good IDEA support
     cons: must start and run container

# Event Bus 5 - Spring Application Context
     ApplicationContext.publishEvent(ApplicationEvent event)
     ApplicationListener

# Presentation Model Pattern
     - Presentation Model vs. Domain Model
     - There is a Domain Model Griffon Plugin
     - Grasp Backgrounder (Canoo & CodeCamp)
     - Grasp Diagrams (old) - Q. How do controllers coordinate many views? 
     - Grasp Demo
     - Grasp Diagrams (new)
     pros - complements event system
