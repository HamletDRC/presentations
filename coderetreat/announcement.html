Next Saturday, 3rd December, Canoo is sponsoring the Swiss installment of the Global Day
of Code Retreat. It's being held in Lugano, which is easily reachable from Switzerland
or Northern Italy. The event is free, lunch is provided, and you'll get a chance
to practice your programming skills while taking part in a world-wide event
that criss-crosses the globe. Sound fun? It will be. Here's what you need to know: 

A code retreat is a day long event where programmers get to practice and hone 
their craft. The format was created three years ago and has been used and improved
regularly since then. During the day we'll use Conway's Game of Life to practice
our design, testing, and pair programming skills. The event has a predefined
format and will be facilitated by Canooie Hamlet D'Arcy. This is quite different
from our Hackergartens, so you may want to read up on the format so you know
what to expect. Michael Hunger has an excellent synopsis of Code Retreat up
on the InfoQ website. 

The originator of the idea is Corey Haines and he will be facilitating the first 
code retreat of the day in Australia and then flying to Hawaii to also facilitate 
the last retreat of the day. There is most likely a code retreat in your area, 
just in case you can't make it to Lugano. Check out the map to see where you can go. 

There are several sponsors for the Code Retreat in Lugano: Canoo, Ex Machina, 
and JetBrains to name a few. If you show up then expect to leave with some 
goodies as well as the free lunch. And please, if you plan on coming then 
be sure to <a href="http://coderetreat.ning.com/events/global-day-of-code-retreat-in-lugano">
register on the website</a> so we can provide enough food and coffee. 

See you Saturday!
