Static Code Analysis and AST Transformations

The goal of static analysis is to let your computer find the bugs and problems in your code before your customers do. 
This session covers several popular and open-source static analysis tools available in the Java ecosystem today, 
and shows how we can use them to improve the quality of our software projects. We'll take a look at IntelliJ IDEA's static
analysis capabilities as well as other projects like CodeNarc, PMD, AndroidLint, and Groovy 2.0. We'll also take a deep
dive into how these tools are built, and how they use a compiler's Abstract Syntax Tree to work their magic.
