h2. Things that really worked
* Yellow & Green Cards

h2. Things that didn't work
* Zero Defect Approach
* Pomodoro? I liked it at least 
* Story board shelf - we really need a real wall board, not some shelf
* Fixed bid vs. Time and Materials - Had some billing issues around this. 
"All projects are fixed bid. Some bids are just more visible than others." David Hussman
For maximum health, you should move cards to done at least as often as you poop. Something is wrong if this isn't true. 
* Effort tracking and statistics/measurements could have been a lot better. But at what cost?
