Green Cards and Hamcordians

* Story cards start are either Green or Yellow. Green cards represent business value. Yellow cards represent technical value. It is rare that a project would have all green or all yellow, but both are possible. A refactoring project is all yellow. A small greenfield project in a known architecture is all green. Most projects have a mix of both. There is, of course, business value that must be delivered. Then there are refactorings and technical debt. There are areas of the code that are overdesigned and underdesigned. There are known technical problems that must be fixed but are not immeditely visible to the customer. 
Green and Yellow cards provides a visual indicator in the planning phase of what type of balance your project has. My Pearson project had almost all Yellow up front, and we wondered why the business side wasn't interested in our project. BIS had a yellow heavy iteration 1, as we moved from GWT 1.4 to 2.0, and then a mix of green heavy iterations until the end, when we were left with all yellow cards in a last iteration. Perfect. If something doesn't have enough time to be finished then it should be a yellow card not a green one. In the planning sessions we would often say things like, "we have too much yellow here" or "we can do this green, but we should do this yellow along with it". The colors helped us see the project and the flow, and it also helped us talk about it and prioritize. I would definitely use Green and Yellow again. 

* Red cards are created for unexpected work. When your story board is filled with red then something has gone wrong! At the end of the iteration, red cards become prioritized and added to the backlog as green or yellow cards. Anyone walking by the story board can see the presence of a red card and know that something has gone wrong. It is an immediate and color based status report. Also, at the end of an iteration with low velicity it is easier to answer the question of "where did our time go?" It went into all of those red cards that were unexpected. In the end we abandoned Red Cards in favor of JIRA tracking, as it was something we could use to collaborate with our customer, but I still like red cards and would use them if the customer were onsite. 

* User stories are recorded as hamcordians. As usual, the left most card is the story title and tasks within the story extend to the right. Each card to the right should to be about 1/2 day in size, with extra sub-tasks extending down below as needed. In this picture we used blue and orange not green and yellow, but you get the picture. Each task has an estimate and the story card has an estimate as well. 
During details planning you expand the accordian for a full view. You move tasks around between stories as needed. 
During release planning you collapse the accordian for high level view. You move stores around the release as needed. 
Hamcordians work great. They are easy to assemble, easy to modify, and easy to reassemble. 
With the flick of the wrist you toggle between 3 different views: high level story, details story, and then subtasks. Very nice. Combine them with yellow and green cards for maximum effect. 
We didn't, but you can layer the persona into the colorband of the story.
