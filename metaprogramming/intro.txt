Intro to Groovy

"Groovy is the REAL Java 2. Henceforth, we can think of the Java language (not the platform) as forever 1.x. Groovy is what the real second version of Java should have been." Neal Ford

What's the Same?
* keywords
* exception handling
* entity definitions and instantiation
* Packaging & Imports
* Java 5 enums, generics

What's Different?
* True OO with no primitives
* String templating
* Closures
* Operator overloading
* Better syntax for new types
* Extended libraries

Groovy Strings
Need Groovy Console
def name = "Hamlet"
println "Hello $name" 


Closures
Need Groovy Console
3.times { println it }
(10..15).each { println it } 
def x = [ 1, 2, 3]
def f = { e -> e.each { println it } } 
f x 

Putting it all together

def names = ["Hamlet", "Scott", "Jason"]
println """
<root>
 <people>
   ${writer -> names.each { writer.write "   <person>$it</person>\n" }}
  </people>
</root>
"""
Amazing glue langauge. 

How does it work? 
groovy & groovyc - standard tools
Bidirectional compiler
It is Class files
Demo of scripts and javap output
Scott: need groovyc and javap in path

What's it good for? Grails
Can we do create-app & create-domain, then briefly show screens and ORM in GrailsConsole?
